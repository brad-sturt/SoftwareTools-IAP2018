# Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning

This session is on modeling and machine learning in R.  We will cover all steps of the  machine learning pipeline in R, which includes:

1. Data Wrangling
2. Basic Missing Data Imputation
3. Model Fitting and Tuning
4. Model Evaluation and Visualization

Following these steps, we will build some predictive models using the Airbnb data set, including Linear Regression, LASSO, Logistic Regression, and CART models.  The materials for this session are available online at <https://github.com/brad-sturt/SoftwareTools-IAP2018/tree/master/Session3>.

# Before the Session

First, `git pull` to ensure that you have the most up-to-date versions of all of the files for this course.  The pre-lecture assignment for this session is **pre-lecture-assignment-3.R**.  Please open the file, install the R packages there which are not already installed on your computer, and double-check that you obtain the same output as in **output-1.png**.

If you have any questions loading the required software, feel free to contact Colin (cpawlows@mit.edu).
