# Post Assignment:

Create an R file in the repository using RStudio (nothing special, just include for example the line 3+4. This requires logging onto to Win-SSHFS if you are on windows). Create a commit with the R file in the terminal, and push the commit to github. Submit on Stellar site for 15.S41 the link to your repo for completition.
